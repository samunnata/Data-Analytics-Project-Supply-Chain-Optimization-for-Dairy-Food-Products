# Data Analytics Project: Supply Chain Optimization for Dairy Food Products

Analyzed 300+ Supply Chain records of Dairy Products using Python for data cleaning, validation, and visualization.
Identified 11.7% spoilage rate, with Cheese at ~24% and Paneer at ~6%, enabling Category-wise risk profiling.
Found strong correlation between temperature/storage duration and spoilage, especially for Cheese & Paneer.
Recommended optimal transport modes (e.g., Cold Truck for Cheese, Refrigerated Van for Milk/Paneer/Curd and Insulated Container for Ghee) to reduce spoilage.
